It should be noted that a++ increases the value of 1 of the variable's type, whereas a = a + 1 only increases the value of the fixed amount 1. In both circumstances, you will receive 1->2, 3.4->4.4 if it is an int, float, etc. If the compiler were intelligent, there would be no change in C. is a modification that affects the variable directly (altering directly bite), as a=a+1 calls for the addition of a and a new number. The expression I = i+1 will increase the value of I and then return the new value. i++ will increase the value of I but it will also return the previous value that I had.
